## Checkers
### Playing The Game:
Checkers is a fairly simple game which has brought joy to millions over its long history. 
Sometimes seen as a precursor to learning chess, the most popular version of checkers 
is played on the same eight-by-eight square board with alternating light and dark colors. 
[there are other configurations using different numbers of squares and pieces]

The game assigns 12 uniform pieces to each of two players. 
Each player’s pieces are either red or black. The pieces are called “Men” initially, 
but can be elevated to “Kings”. Men are placed only on the darker squares of the first three rows on opposite sides of the board. 


#### Winning The Game:
The goal of the game is to either eliminate all of the opponent’s pieces, or be the first to prevent the opponent from making legal moves.
